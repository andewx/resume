Computer science graduate student with proven problem solving, organizational and leadership skills. While I've spent the majority of my career in the profession of arms as a Non-Commissioned Officer, I have dualy committed myself to being both a scholar and warrior. With that I have embraced continuous development and personal growth in all facets of life with the goal of excellence in all that I do. From an academic standpoint I am ready for the advanced mathematics required for research and for state of the art applications in Computer Science with foundations in statistical methods in linear algebraic systems. My service in active duty is one of extreme committment to the Air Force and has resulted in recieving distinguished titles such as NCO of the year with multiple packages considered at the Air Force Level which puts me far ahead of my peers. 

## `SKILLS`
 - Parallel/Distributed Computing (OpenMP)
 - Low-Level Machine Code / Systems (LLVM IR)
 - Machine Learning / Neural Networks
 - Advance Statistics / Linear Algebra / Calculus
 - Meteoroligical Datasets / Visual Weather Functional Analysis
 - **Important** Flexible and dynamic learner, was able to succeed in Advanced Statistics UIS 420 with waiver for Calculus III.

## ``PROJECTS``

All projects are independently pursued and self-directed unless

**Leopard**
> Evolution of the GoLang high level language specification with static compilation and JIT with LLVM toolchain support, fully supports C, C++, Objective-C integration with Clang compatibility. https://leolang.org

**Vlk**
> GoLang integration of Vulkan C API with higher level rendering engine capabilities. Designed to allow unification of compute kernel architecture with Vulkan Graphics API, helpful on systems which have deprecated or limited OpenGL support (mac os x).

**Fluidity**
> Golang Computational Fluid Dynamics solver API, provides solver interfaces for both Grid, SPH, and Hybrid methods. Supports compute to render pipeline for fluid compute solvers.

**Axm**
> Ray based atmospheric effects simulation, computes lightpath scattering equations for a spectral based light source and simulates realistic and composable atmospheres.

**Lever**
> Packaging and versioning system for Leo Language.

**XYZ**

> Undergraduate software capstone project. Using Java with "Gradle" developed highly distributable REST API binary with distributed in-memory database. Entire project utilized no major dependencies and built in < 10MB and demonstrated high throughput capabilities. 

## ``LANGUAGES``
Have experience writing my own fully executable statically compiled language across multiple platforms. However, these are my preferred languages:

- Golang, Java, Swift, C++, C

## ``INTERESTS``
- GPU Computation/Simulation (SPH/FLIP FLuids / Path-Tracing / Numerical)
- Distributed Systems / Systems Architecture
- Languages & Services
- Neural Network Solvers
