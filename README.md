## ``PROJECTS``
**Leopard Language**
> Evolution of the GoLang high level language specification with static compilation and JIT with LLVM toolchain support, fully supports C, C++, Objective-C integration with Clang compatibility. https://leolang.org

**Dieselvlk**
> GoLang integration of Vulkan C API with higher level rendering engine capabilities. Designed to allow unification of compute kernel architecture with Vulkan Graphics API, helpful on systems which have deprecated or limited OpenGL support.

**DieselFluid**
> Golang Computational Fluid Dynamics solver API, provides solver interfaces for both Grid, SPH, and Hybrid methods. Supports compute to render pipeline for fluid compute solvers.

**DieselAtm**
> Ray based atmospheric effects simulation, computes lightpath scattering equations for a spectral based light source and simulates realistic and composable atmospheres.
